# BikeLanesandTruckroutes

This file shows bike lane and truck routes in NYC. It also shows what streets have both bike lanes and truck routes. 

The goal of this research is to show the relationship between truck routes and bike routes in regards to bike fatalities. Google maps and other trip planner apps will usually send Bikers to bike lane streets instead of adjacent non bike lane streets. However, truck activity is usually not considered when developing these trip routes.
