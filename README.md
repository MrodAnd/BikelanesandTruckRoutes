# BikeLanesandTruckroutes

This file shows bike lane and truck routes in NYC. It also shows what streets have both bike lanes and truck routes. 

The goal of this research is to show the relationship between truck routes and bike routes in regards to bike fatalities. Over 50% of pedestrian and bike fatalies happen on truck routes even though they make up just 13% of existing Streets.

Google maps and other trip planner apps will usually send Bikers to bike lane streets instead of adjacent non bike lane streets. However, truck activity is usually not considered when developing these trip routes. This map aims to show if bike accidents involving trucks happen on streets that are also dedicated to bikers. 

This map was created using Mapbox as well as truck routes and bike lanes that were exported from QGIS.
